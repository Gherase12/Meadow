    texts:["Meadow is a launchpad domiciled on the Sui blockchain. As a decentralized incubator, meadow offers various tools for blockchain innovators eyeing the Sui blockchain — especially for gaming projects.The Sui Blockchain is an offshoot of the Move programming language developed by Meta-backed project, Diem. A layer 1 of Ethereum and Avalanche’s caliber but with better unique features like high throughput and zero latency. Sui augmented the Move language to form what is called the Sui Move — an improvement on the laxities contained in the parent move language.","To foster transparency in the meadow ecosystem, this piece will take a look at how Meadow plans on keeping its ecosystem’s economics functional and beneficial for both the host and builders.","To generate revenue for the long run, meadow looks to deduct 1% fee for every trade that happens.This fees goes into the treasury and converted into stable coins that will be used to fund various endeavors, like: \n\nOn-boarding Team Members \nCollaborate With Prospective Partners \nBuilding and Marketing \nPaying Employees \nTo Improve Meadow’s Overall Brand \n\nScenario: \n\n$10,000,000 Total Volume = $100,000 Revenue​ \n\n$50,000,000 Total Volume = $500,000 Revenue \n\nMeadow is expected to generate $100,000 in revenue in the first month from this unique revenue source which equates to $10,000,000 in volume.","If there’s one thing 2022 has taught every citizen of the cryptoverse: it is that the mighty can fall at a time when everyone least expects. Just like FTX, and its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. The crypto winter and the recent crypto catastrophes prompted the Meadow team to create an insurance model for every project launched on through its platform. \n\nEvery project that meadow grooms and launches will remit 5–10% of its total raise at IDO into the insurance pool. This will compound over time into a canopy pool where certain investors can get a fraction of their invested capital in case their project plummets. The insurance pool has different tiers: Diamond, Gold, Silver, Bronze.\n\nDiamond: When Meadow helps launch a project that is subscribed to the Diamond tier, the builders are entitled to 30% of their invested capital if things fall apart.\n\nGold: The Gold hierarchy presents 15% of invested capital if the project fails.\n\nSilver and Bronze: These tiers aren’t entitled to the insurance pool.",
    "We know Sui is one of the most superior networks, but Meadow will first launch on the BEP20 Network. Then we will bridge back to the Sui Network while the ecosystem grows. This is a more responsible approach. One of the main advantages is that the BEP20 Network processes on average three million transactions per day, showing its high throughput. This means that the Meadow token will be more accessible, putting our token at a huge advantage. Although Sui has been growing rapidly, we believe it is better to strategically plan everything for the first couple months and then launch. And when we launch on the Sui Network, we’ll be going multichain. In terms of when Meadow will do its Public IDO: it will be sometime in April — May time. This gives us enough time to plan everything out and make sure we are going in the right direction.\n\n"]
